## Laboratories
### Lab 1: Overview
This laboratory project focuses on the implementation and analysis of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids for image compression and reconstruction.

### Lab 2: Overview
This laboratory project focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of the architectures of **LeNet**, **AlexNet** and **VGG**, through both theoretical analysis and practical experimentation. The goal is to evaluate and compare these models based on their structural characteristicsâ€”such as layer depth, filter sizes, activation functions, number of parameters, and regularization techniques like pooling and dropout. 

After identifying the strengths of each architecture, the most effective components are combined to design a custom convolutional neural network, named **MyCNN**. This new model aims to balance performance and complexity by leveraging the best design choices from the studied architectures.

The dataset used for training and evaluation is a custom subset of the CIFAR-100 dataset, uniquely determined by a team-specific seed value.
